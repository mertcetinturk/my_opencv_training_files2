# my_opencv_training_files
These are the OpenCV training files I created while studying Opencv.

In these files, there are some notes I wrote to remember what I did and why I did it this way. These notes are written in Turkish. 

With this repository, I have completed the first phase of the OpenCV part of my 'Computer Vision' work.
